If you don't have any programming background, it is RECOMMENDED to go through and understand the **First steps** below...

## First steps - recommended for people who are new to programming

Some things to read before we get to the exercises

1. [How a computer works](./1-getting-started-with-programming/1-How-a-computer-works.md)
1. [Basic programming building blocks](./1-getting-started-with-programming/2-Basic-programming-building-blocks.md)

## Tutorials - A guided exercise

To complete these tutorials, just follow the steps in the tutorial.

1. bash: [Getting started with Bash](./tutorial/bash-tutorial.md)
2. git: [Getting started with Git](./tutorial/git-tutorial.md)
3. git-notes: [Create your own repo to store your notes, and become more familiar with git](./tutorial/git-notes-tutorial.md)
4. hello world: [Getting started with programming](./tutorial/hello-world.md)
5. selenium: [automate any web browser](./tutorial/selenium-tutorial.md)
6. cypress: [automated and bdd tests](./tutorial/cypress-tutorial.md)

## Questions - You can submit them back to test your understanding

> IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT WORK ON MASTER, I.E. NEVER COMMIT ONTO MASTER, RATHER CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH AND WORK ON IT
> To answer these questions, create a branch off from master with the same name as the excercise marked in **bold**. [This will show you how](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch)

[After you create a new branch](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch), you can edit the quesion's `.md` file with your answers, and commit and push it when you are done.

1. GIT (questions): create a branch called **understand-git-commands**
   - Have a look at the [git-cheatsheet](./cheatsheets/git.md)
   - _Complete the questions_ by modifying and commiting the changes in [git-questions](./questions/understand-git-commands-questions.md)
1. SBT (questions): create a branch called **understand-sbt-project-excercise**
   - Have a look at the [sbt-cheatsheet](./cheatsheets/sbt.md)
   - _Complete the questions_ by modifying and commiting the changes in [sbt-questions](./questions/understand-sbt-project-excercise.md)

## Tasks - Getting your hands dirty

> IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT WORK ON MASTER, I.E. NEVER COMMIT ONTO MASTER, RATHER CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH AND WORK ON IT
> To answer these questions, create a branch off from master with the same name as the excercise marked in **bold**. [This will show you how](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch)

[After you create a new branch](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch), you can complete the task by commiting your changes to the source files.

1. Scalatest (task): **add-scala-tests-for-functions-excercise**
   - Create more tests for the cubed function
   - Add tests for the multiply and add functions
   - _Complete this exercise_ by modifying and commiting the file [ToTestOrNotToTestSpec.scala](../src/test/scala/ToTestOrNotToTestSpec.scala)
